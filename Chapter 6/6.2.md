### Exercise 6.2-2
Starting with the procedure MAX-HEAPIFY, write pseudocode for the procedure
MIN-HEAPIFY(A, i), which performs the corresponding manipulation on a minheap. How does the running time of MIN-HEAPIFY compare to that of MAXHEAPIFY?

    MIN-HEAPIFY(A, i)
        l = LEFT(i)
        r = RIGHT(i)
        if l <= A.heap-size and A[l] < A[i]
            smallest = l
        else 
            smallest = i
        if r <= A.heap-size and A[r] < A[i]
            smallest = r
        if smallest != i
            exchange A[i] with A[smallest]
            MIN-HEAPIFH(A, i)

the running time is the same.

### Exercise 6.2-3

What is the effect of calling MAX-HEAPIFY(A, i) when the element A[i] is larger
than its children?

It means that the subtree rooted at i is max-heap, and it will change nothing.

### Exercise 6.2-4

What is the effect of calling MAX-HEAPIFY(A, i) for i > A.heap-size/2?

It will return, because A[i] is all leaves where i > A.heap-size/2.

### Exercise 6.2-5

The code for MAX-HEAPIFY is quite efficient in terms of constant factors, except possibly for the recursive call in line 10, which might cause some compilers to
produce inefficient code. Write an efficient MAX-HEAPIFY that uses an iterative
control construct (a loop) instead of recursion.

    MAX-HEAPIFY-ITERATIVELY(A, i)
        while i < A.heap-size/2
            l = LEFT(i)
            r = RIGHT(i)
            largest = i
            if A[l] > A[i]
                largest = l
            if A[r] > A[i]
                largest = r
            if largest != i
                exchange A[i] with A[largest]
                i = largest

### Exercise 6.2-6

Show that the worst-case running time of MAX-HEAPIFY on a heap of size n
is $\Omega(\lg n)$. (Hint: For a heap with n nodes, give node values that cause MAXHEAPIFY to be called recursively at every node on a simple path from the root
down to a leaf.)

The worst-cast is that MAXHEAPIFY to be called recursively at every node on a simple path from the root down to a leaf, and the tree's height is $\lfloor \lg n \rfloor$, so the running time is $\Omega(\lg n)$.
