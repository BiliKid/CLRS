### Exercise 6.3-2

Why do we want the loop index i in line 2 of BUILD-MAX-HEAP to decrease from
$\lfloor A.length/2 \rfloor$ to 1 rather than increase from 1 to $\lfloor A.length/2 \rfloor$ ?

Because increasing from 1 to $\lfloor A.length/2 \rfloor$ do not have the prerequistie of MAX-HEAPIFY that the children of the node must be the root of a max-heap.

### Exercise 6.3-3

Show that there are at most $\lceil n/2^{h+1} \rceil$ nodes of height h in any n-element heap.

If it's a complete binary tree, it's easy to prove $\lceil n/2^{h+1} \rceil$ is true.  
If it isn't, suppose we add m new leaves on old tree, then the number of the heap will be n + m, thus
MAX-ELEMENT=$\lceil n/2^{h+1} \rceil$ < $\lceil (n + m)/2^{h+1} \rceil$
is also true.
