### Exercise 2.3-1

Using Figure 2.4 as a model, illustrate the operation of merge sort on the array
A = {3, 41, 52, 26, 38, 57, 9, 49}.

    | 3    9   26   38   41   49  52   57 | 
    | ----------------------------------- |
    | 3   26   41   52 | 9    38  49   57 |
    | ---------------- | ---------------- |
    | 3   41 | 26   52 | 38   57 | 9   49 |
    | ------ | ------- | ------- | ------ |
    | 3 | 41 | 52 | 26 | 38 | 57 | 9 | 49 |

### Exercise 2.3-2

Rewrite the MERGE procedure so that it does not use sentinels, instead stopping
once either array L or R has had all its elements copied back to A and then copying
the remainder of the other array back into A.

```
MERGE(A, p, q, r) 
    n1 = q - p + 1
    n2 = r - q
    let L[1..n1] and R[1..n2] be new arrays
    for i = 1 to n1
        L[i] = A[p + i - 1]
    for j = 1 to n2
        R[j] = A[q + j]
    i = 1
    j = 1
    k = p
    for k = p to r
        if i > n1
            A[k] = R[j]
            j += 1
        else if j > n2
            A[k] = L[i]
            i += 1
        else if L[i] > R[j]
            A[k] = R[j]
            j += 1
        else 
            A[k] = L[i]
            i += 1
```

### Exercise 2.3-3

Use mathematical induction to show that when n is an exact power of 2, the solution of the recurrence
$$
T(n) =
  \begin{cases}
    2       & \quad \text{if } n =2 \\
    2T(n/2) + n  & \quad \text{if } n = 2^k\text{ for k > 1}
  \end{cases}
$$
is $T(n) = n\lg n$

Assume that $T(2^k) = 2^k\lg 2^k$ is correct, then 
$$
\begin{aligned}
T(2^{k+1}) & = 2T(2^k) + 2^{k+1} \\
& = 2*2^k\lg 2^k + 2^{k+1} \\
& = 2^{k+1}(\lg 2^k + 1) \\
& = 2^{k+1}\lg 2^{k+1}
\end{aligned}
$$
so $T(n) = n\lg n$

### Exercise 2.3-4

We can express insertion sort as a recursive procedure as follows. In order to sort
A[1..n], we recursively sort A[1..n-1]and then insert A[n] into the sorted array
A[1..n-1]. Write a recurrence for the running time of this recursive version of
insertion sort.

$$
T(n) = 
\begin{cases}
1 & \text{if } n = 1, \\
T(n-1) + n - 1 & \text{if }n > 1.
\end{cases}
$$

### Exercise 2.3-5

Referring back to the searching problem (see Exercise 2.1-3), observe that if the
sequence A is sorted, we can check the midpoint of the sequence against _v_ and
eliminate half of the sequence from further consideration. The binary search algorithm repeats this procedure, halving the size of the remaining portion of the
sequence each time. Write pseudocode, either iterative or recursive, for binary
search. Argue that the worst-case running time of binary search is $\Theta(\lg n)$.

```
//iterative
BINARY-SEARCH-ITER(A, v)
    b = 1
    e = A.length
    while b <= h
        mid = (b + e) / 2
        if A[mid] = v
            return mid
        else if A[mid] > v
            e = mid -1
        else 
            b = mid + 1
    return NIL

//recursive
BINARY-SEARCH-REC(A, v, b, e)
    if b > e
        return NIL
    mid = (b + e) / 2
    if A[mid] == v
        return mid
    else if A[mid] > v
        return BINARY-SEARCH-REC(A, v, b, mi-1)
    else 
        return BINARY-SEARCH-REC(A, v, mid+1, e)
    
```
The running time of this divide-and-conquer is $T(n)=T(n/2) + 1$.  
The worst-cast is that A contains no _v_, so it's $\Theta(\lg n)$.

### Exercise 2.3-6

Observe that the while loop of lines 5â€“7 of the INSERTION-SORT procedure in
Section 2.1 uses a linear search to scan (backward) through the sorted subarray
A[1..j-1]. Can we use a binary search (see Exercise 2.3-5) instead to improve
the overall worst-case running time of insertion sort to $\Theta(n lg n)$?

Absolutely we cann't. Because we need to move the greater element back, So its running time is still $\Theta(n)$, and overall worst-cast running time is $\Theta(n^2)$.

### Exercise 2.3-7 

Describe $\Theta(n lg n)$-time algorithm that, given a set S of n integers and another
integer x, determines whether or not there exist two elements in S whose sum is
exactly x.


We can sort S using merge-sort firstly, then do a binary-search. So the overall running time is $\Theta(n\lg n)$.
