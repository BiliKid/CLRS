### Exercise 2.1-2

    Rewrite the INSERTION-SORT procedure to sort into nonincreasing instead of nondecreasing order.

```
INSERTION-SORT-ASC(A)
    for j = 2 to A.length
        key = A[j]
        i = j - 1
        while i > 0 and A[i] < key
            A[i + 1] = A[i]
            i = i - 1
        A[i + 1] = key
```

### Exercise 2.1-3

    Consider the searching problem:
    Input: A sequence of n numbers A = {a1, a2, ..., an} and a value v.
    Output: An index i such that v = A[i] or the special value NIL if v does not appear in A.
    Write pseudocode for linear search, which scans through the sequence, looking for v. Using a loop invariant, prove that your algorithm is correct. Make sure that your loop invariant fulfills the three necessary properties.

```
LINEAR-SEARCH(A, v)
    for i = 1 to A.length
        if A[i] == v
            return i
    return NIL

loop invariant: At the start of each iteration of the for loop of lines 1â€“3, the subarray
A[1..i-1] don't contain value v.

Initialization: the subarray is empty, so it's true.
Maintenance: if A[i] equal to v, we terminate the loop and return i, or continue. So the subarray A[1..i-1] will not contain v before i-th iteration. And it's hold if A[i] not equal to v.
Termination: it's terminated in two cases,
1. there is index i so that A[i] == v.
2. Search to the end of A, do not find v, so return NIL.
