### Exercise 7.1-1
Using Figure 7.1 as a model, illustrate the operation of PARTITION on the array A ={13, 19, 9, 5, 12, 8, 7, 4, 21, 2, 6, 11}.

    13  19  9   5   12  8   7   4   21  2   6   11
    9   19  13  5   12  8   7   4   21  2   6   11
    9   5   13  19  12  8   7   4   21  2   6   11
    9   5   8   19  12  13  7   4   21  2   6   11
    9   5   8   7   12  13  19  4   21  2   6   11
    9   5   8   7   4   13  19  12  21  2   6   11
    9   5   8   7   4   2   19  12  21  13  6   11
    9   5   8   7   4   2   6   12  21  13  19  11
    9   5   8   7   4   2   6   11  21  13  19  12

### Exercise 7.1-2
What value of q does PARTITION return when all elements in the array A[p..r]
have the same value? Modify PARTITION so that q=$\lfloor (p+r)/2 \rfloor$ when all
elements in the array A[p..r] have the same value.

It will return r when all elements in A is same.

    PARTITION(A, p, r)
        x = A[r]
        i = p - 1
        count = 0
        for j = p to r-1
            if A[j] == x
                count += 1
            if A[j] <= x
                i += 1
                exchange A[i] with A[j]
        exchange A[i+1] with A[r]
        return i + 1 - (count/2)

### Exercise 7.1-3
Give a brief argument that the running time of PARTITION on a subarray of size n is $\Theta(n)$.

The for loop takes exactly r-p times iteration, so the running time is  $\Theta(n)$.

### Exercise 7.1-4
How would you modify QUICKSORT to sort into nonincreasing order?

Just change the condition of line 4 to A[j] > x.
