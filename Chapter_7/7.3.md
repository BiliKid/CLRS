### Exercise 7.3-1

Why do we analyze the expected running time of a randomized algorithm and not
its worst-case running time?

Because the expected running time of a randomized algorithm is the average-case, it happens in most cases.

### Exercise 7.3-2

When RANDOMIZED-QUICKSORT runs, how many calls are made to the randomnumber generator RANDOM in the worst case? How about in the best case? Give
your answer in terms of $\Theta$-notation.

Suppose that the randomnumber is the largest number every time in the worst case, and the problem's size reduce to n-1. So the running time is $\Theta(n)$.  
The best case is also $\Theta(n)$, because 
$$T(n)=2T(n/2)+1$$ 
is also $\Theta(n)$ according to the master theorem.
